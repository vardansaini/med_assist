# About
Developed this Application for HackED(Hackathon).

We were team of 4 and made prototype of this app in less than 24hrs.

My contributions can be seen on https://github.com/Bhavnoor-Kaur/med_assist.

## Getting Started

The mobile application "MedAssist" that can send these people reminders about medications, keeps a record of all the medical conditions they have had in the past (which are then automatically sent to the health authorities in case of emergency) and also connects them to volunteers in case they need help with anything. This application also features an emergency button, which when prompted sends an alert with the person's location to all the family members and nearby volunteers to assist the person. The person needing help is matched with the closest volunteer that is available.
